### Process Mining with Celonis EMS

1. **Sign Up and Upload Data:**
   - Signed up for a Celonis EMS trial account.
   - Uploaded the cleaned sales data.

2. **Create Event Log:**
   - Converted the dataset into an event log format with columns: 'order_id', 'date', 'activity', 'resource'.
   - Uploaded the event log to Celonis EMS.

3. **Analysis:**
   - Used Celonis EMS to perform process mining.
   - Discovered process models and identified inefficiencies.
   - Analyzed bottlenecks and suggested improvements.

4. **Insights:**
   - Documented key insights from the analysis, such as process inefficiencies, bottlenecks, and recommendations for optimization.
